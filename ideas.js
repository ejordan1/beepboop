the machine will go to the number that you give it, and will
use that amount of power

it will add heat whenenver it gets to a 3

it will lose power for every second, beeps and boops take a bit longer

the point is to get it to go to infinite power and speed, which occurs when the amount of speed that it is gaining from the overheat suprasses the amount of power it drains

if it ever loses power completely it resets, and its heat goes to 0

it gains less heat for every subsequent sorry after another sorry

how to structure the entire thing:

in a while loop: while !playerWon() has not been reached
attach submit here:
read: enter the next number
then when submit is called,
  starts for loop for number given.
  timetaken is an inverse relation to heat

beep and boop make actual sounds. so does im sorry dave

beep and boop just make it subtract 3 times the normal power, but still in relation to the maxHeat

function playerWon(){
}
